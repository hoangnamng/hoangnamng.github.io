Introducing to my Ethical Hacking Process.

<!--more-->

Currently i'm a final year college student who studying on Information and Security Technology at [Vietnam Academy of Cryptography Techniques](https://actvn.edu.vn/).

To be honest, i'm sooooooo lazy and can't study in a focused and serious way. Howerver, i really have a passion for `Ethical Hacking Penestration`, so, i create this blog to share my process on studying pentest. And by the way, this work also help me practice my writing skills as well as my English.

For those who accidentally access this site, I hope you follow my work. In case I stop updating this site, please contact me through my social media accounts listed on the main page! :rofl: .
